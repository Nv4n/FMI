## ERP system definition

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a category of business management software that integrates and manages core business processes such as finance, human resources, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, procurement, and customer relationship management (CRM).
 It operates as a unified system with a shared database, enabling real-time data sharing, reducing manual work, and improving accuracy across departments.
 ERP systems provide a single source of truth by consolidating data from various functions into one centralized platform, which enhances visibility, supports informed decision-making, and facilitates efficient operations.
 The software is designed to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks like invoicing and payroll, and connect internal processes with external stakeholders, making it essential for modern business management.
