# Gypsies are not the solution to Bulgaria's problems

GERB, the Citizens for European Development, bent to Karakachanov's will, just to win another day or month in power. They accepted to hold a referendum on the introduction of an education requirement for voting, compulsory barracks, a ban on same-sex marriages and other "progressive" ideas. "The referendum will be held in parallel with the elections to the Grand National Assembly," VMRO's deputy Iskren Veselinov announced.

Well, in that case we have good news - these elections will definitely not happen, given that GERB scrape together 120 votes needed to submit the draft for a new constitution. They served Mareshki's people and now "VOLYA" is a bit of a mandate bearer... Mareshki showed in front of the whole nation how to buy and sell parliamentary votes! Against two concessions - on the beaches "Kabakum - North 1" and "Kabakum - North 2". One is said to have been in favor of Mareshki's mother, while the other favored a former deputy from VOLYA.

And how many more and what sales are going around the National Assembly?! Even whole parties are selling themselves out. Ataka, for example, is leased by DPS and Peevski!

But the big problem is the gypsies...

By accepting a referendum on the education requirement GERB will look for those 160 votes they need for convocation of the Grand National Assembly when the pigs fly. The introduction of an education threshold also affects the electorate of the DPS. Dogan's voters do not vote for pay in the literal sense of the word. Their vote is more complex and multi-layered. There is also ethnic fear, layered from the recent "Revival Process" past, and purely social fear in the settlements where the Agha "wags the dog"... By their very agreement to put the question of the education requirement to a referendum, GERB has eliminated the last opportunities to negotiate with the DPS collecting the necessary votes for the Grand National Assembly. In fact, the 25 deputies of the DPS do not solve the issue at all. But, as it has already become known to the crows, it is not the Grand National Assembly or the change of the constitution that are GERB's goal. The goal is much simpler and pragmatic - finishing the mandate. Because this time it might be the last. In any case, GERB will never get such unlimited power again.

There is saying - follow a beetle,and you will find... It is the same to walk behind the patriots. A few years ago it was the patriots who managed to enforce compulsory voting. And it led to an unprecedented increase in voter turnout and, consequently, to greater legitimacy of the government.

You wish!

If compulsory voting had any effect, it was in favour of the bought vote. The state is practically delivering the "goods" right to the vote brokers' doorstep.

In its current form, the Bulgarian constitution does not allow any form of electoral census. Article 10 stipulates: "Elections... shall be held on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot."

And in Article 6 it is said: "(2) All citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no restrictions on rights or privileges based on race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, origin, religion, education, beliefs, political affiliation, personal and social status or property."

The constitution also says in Article 53, that everyone has the right to education and that schooling up to the age of 16 is compulsory! But this necessarily remains on the books. The provisions of the constitution are being smashed at the entrance of the ghettos. And this applies not only to education...
<!-- DONE -->

This is not the first time that the idea of an education threshold has appeared in the public sphere. Citizens, politicians and academics have spoken out in favour of it. They are usually of the breed who cannot exist outside provocation. No, it's not just about Siderov...

In 2015 Prof. Konstantinov said that it was time to consider some form of educational requirement. He suggested complicating the ballots so that Gypsies couldn't keep up.

I don't know. However, there is a video that has been on YouTube for a long time, in which an underage gypsy recites "The Battle of Shipka" without a mistake, like an artist from a drama troupe. I have no doubt that for a few bucks, gypsies can learn the Hare-Niemeyer methodology. Gypsies are dumb without money. For money, they will learn even a language. Meanwhile, some Bulgarians, even if they become prime ministers, still don't learn a thing...

In GERB, and at a high level, there are also people who are in favour of introducing an education requirement. At the end of 2018, Vice Minister Tomislav Donchev said: "It's only right to limit the rights of people who don't have at least a basic education. Education should be a priority, it determines how Bulgaria will look like in 10-15 years."
<!-- DONE -->

These ideas of Donchev are heretical in a GERB environment. For Borissov the smart ones were not interesting because they are few. Important for him were others. To the clever the others are the dumb, are they not? So Borissov can't help but be against disenfranchising the "important" ones. But power still remains above all!

Among the voters there are people who cannot read and write, although primary education is compulsory. Illiteracy goes hand in hand with poverty. And these poor illiterates regularly sell their vote. According to the Transparency International, the bought vote is up to 8%. And it seems unfair to many people that primary illiterate voters, who are moreover complete dependents of the state i.e., us citizens, get to choose who governs us. The majority of these people have not paid one penny in taxes in their lifetime. We feed them and will continue to feed them. And that is the right thing to do. God save us from hungry gypsies! And they will continue to live the same way. Because that is their mentality. (See Dr. Filippov, On the Mentality of the gypsies, Writings, Volume III). A way to integrate the gypsies has yet to be devised. There is hope that this can be done through education, but there is no way to verify this. Because of the united resistance of the Gypsy community. And the unwillingness of the state to seriously address the return of gypsies to school. Actions are taken on a campaign basis. Anyone still remember the Decade of Roma Inclusion? GERB doubled the fines for parents of children not attending school. Is anyone bothering to enforce and collect these fines? I'm not asking, I'm telling!

Another theory is that the Roma travel the world and might pick up a thing or two along the way. And they do. The other day I listened to a gypsy woman cussing in the market: May Picasso paint you, damn it! With your eyes in your mouth and your ears in your nose...

We didn't used to have curses like that around here. The swearing was simpler: 'May you build a house out of kidney stones...

Enough with the jokes. Taking away the right to vote of the Gypsies, most of them semi-literate (and soon completely illiterate!) is a step towards further ghettoization of the ethnic group. The poorer, simpler and more disenfranchised the gypsies, the more dangerous they will become to society. Because, the way they're multiplying like Fibonacci's rabbits, in a few decades the gypsies will become the majority in the Bulgarian nation. In fact, no one knows how many there are. They are probably chasing a million, or may have passed it. And our descendants will live in a society dominated by gypsies. Not poorly educated, but completely illiterate gypsies. Well-mannered, whole generations now, who think they have no responsibilities to society, that the laws don't apply to them.
<!-- DONE -->

But the society, the state and the media behave as if the problem will solve itself. In fact, it will solve itself. At some point it will cease to be a problem of the Bulgarians and will become a problem of the Gypsies. Demographics is ruthless. A Bulgarian woman gives birth to one, maximum two. And whatever she produces, she immediately sends abroad... Ayshe gives birth as soon as she can, until she can no longer.

And then the problem will be theirs to think about.

(We're on our way.) Where to? Nobody knows. The good thing about not knowing where you're going is that you don't have to worry about which way you're going.

The main arguments of the supporters of the education requirement are that this will limit and even eliminate the paid vote of uneducated gypsies. And it will improve the quality of the parliamentary body because educated people are capable of making more accurate choices.

Sounds good, but hardly true. Professional education and civic culture are fundamentally different things. I can point you to more than one or two graduates, even PhDs, associate professors and professors, who are still in the primary grades of civic education.

By the way, the Constitution of Tarnovo stipulates an educational requirement, but only for the passive right: "All Bulgarian citizens who enjoy civil and political rights and are above the age of 30 and are literate are eligible!

In the current constitution there is no guarantee that an illiterate MP can get into the National Assembly. With the prevailing system in some parties of selling the seats in the lists, we can end up one day with an MP who cannot read... Even now there are complete morons among the MPs...

So maybe we should start with the educational qualification for the electors and then think about the educational qualification of the electors. Against the background of the ugly sales of MPs and whole parliamentary groups, the problem of the Gypsies seems secondary. Gypsies sell, but Bulgarians buy! So instead of blaming the Gypsies for selling their votes, we can blame the Bulgarians, the Bulgarian politicians and parties for buying the Gypsy votes.

As far as the quality of popular representation is concerned, it will increase when parties stop trading seats in their lists and start including educated and worthy individuals.

So I wanted to say that the solution to Bulgaria's problems is not the gypsies. And as for the education requirement, this road is slippery and dangerous. Today the patriots want the voters to have primary education, tomorrow someone else will ask for secondary, then higher education and finally only the doctors of science will be left with the right to vote - me, Kostov, Dogan, Stanishev, the doctor of physical sciences Borisov... If it is from a small doctor upwards, otherwise we will burn too...
