# Uninformed love

Over the weekend Borissov was again touring the forgotten places of his homeland, embraced and kissed the descendants of Grandpa Yotzo, for the first time touching Bulgarian statehood, and thus still capable of being moved to tears.

A friend says that Borissov in his ripe old age joined the initiative "Get to know your homeland to truly love it". Because, you know, you can't love something you don't perceive. Although especially for Bulgarians it can be the other way around, if you understand me. (It certainly can for Borissov.)

And another friend says that, after he went around all the villages and
villages on the outskirts of his homeland, where he is loved
(uninformed!) and do not protest against his rule,
he intended to continue on the maps of the First
Bulgarian state, of which he was the direct heir.  All significant,
made in our lands is his work. Asparuh only founded
the state, Boris baptized it, and the brothers Cyril and Methodius
gave us letters to read and write (to some of us!). And from there on
everything is the work of GERB and Borisov personally. There were some doubts
about Todor Zhivkov's contribution. He had built as much as we have not
could paint. But then it turned out that what we could not
paint, was actually built by Borisov. From the new statesmen
under suspicion was Ivan Kostov. There were hesitations whether he was not
had done something for the development of our country, but nothing was
proved. In a word, we live in a Boykocentric universe and there is no
our history not to be Boykocentric. For now. But as he likes to
Dr. Filippov says, Clio is the biggest whore among the muses. The time of
Borisov is passing and Clio is already flipping the pancake. And slowly and slowly
people are seeing that the king really is naked. The whole
Byzantineism in politics, voluntarism in the economy, populism
and demagoguery in the social sphere, the
foreign policy... That last one shone, the fool himself
admitted in an uncontroverted recording how he pretended to be dumb while their
pushing the European leaders with 200, excuse me...

By the way, past the recordings of his informal conversations, I think that if 15 years after he became mayor of Sofia and changed the environment in which he works and, presumably, communicates with at least moderately intelligent people, Borisov did not change the sociolect of thugs, it means that he continues to communicate with them. Otherwise, where will he fill his vocabulary with the neologisms of the underground? Right, isn't it?

I got carried away, I wanted to tell you something else. About Borisov's visit to Lovech and the surrounding area. And because his tour is a little bit of an electoral thing, he visited the Cathedral of St. Sv. Cyril and Methodius". To have an occasion to remind that for its renovation his government has so far allocated 828 000 BGN, and his party added nearly a million more.

"This temple was built for the people because it is important for us to keep our faith, the Prime Minister told us. - I am glad that the decision not to close the churches for Easter and Palm Sunday turned out to be the right one. The Lord made sure that we kept people healthy and I thank all the bishops and priests."

Не знам, може и Господ да го е направил. Аз в тия работи избягвам да
се бъркам. Но друго не мога да разбера. Как така децата ще се душат
на училище с маски, а той се среща с хиляди хора без маска. Пардон,
преувеличих малко – десетки, тук-таме стотици! Но и с трима души да
говори, пак е важно какъв пример дава на гражданите! Щото така
работа заприличва на оня действителен случай, дето Иванчо гледал
през ключалката какво правят майка му и баща му в спалнята и
погнусен възкликнал: И тия хора ще ми казват да не си бъркам в носа!

I don't know, maybe God did it. I avoid meddling in these things. But I cannot understand anything else. How come kids will be showering at school with masks on and he's meeting thousands of people without a mask. Pardon my exaggeration - dozens, here and there hundreds! But even if he talks to three people, it's still important what kind of example he sets for the citizens! Because this way the work resembles that real case, when Ivancho watched through the keyhole what his mother and father were doing in the bedroom and disgusted exclaimed.

At the height of the pandemic, he wore the mask like a bib, now he's ditched it. God will protect us! But if you ask Grandpa Pope, he will tell you that God gives, but does not bring into the fold. God only warns, "Beware..."

We will fight the pandemic with 50 leva pension supplements! Let them devour, get immunity, and hopefully live until the elections. Because it is no secret to anyone that this BSP electorate is stealing it and sharing it with God...

And again I return to uninformed love. I don't know why God is helping us in the pandemic. And Borisov why he helps I have no explanation. At least he should be informed... Boris Dimovsky used to say that God makes the lame stork's nest. And it's hard to imagine a lamer stork than this one...

And I have written about Borisov's Christian faith many times. But when I watched how he crossly kissed the hand of the bishop, how he dragged the icon of St. St. Mary of God under his arm like a gypsy manhole cover, it came to me. The photos don't show if he has at least removed the red thread from his cunque. He wore it until recently. Even though the BOC announced a few years ago that it was starting a war on superstition. The Vladyka jumped specifically against the red thread. They insisted that the Synod condemn this pagan tradition, condemn fortune tellers, witch doctors and various other superstitions. The word "superstition" means empty, meaningless (in vain) belief, useless faith. According to the Church, belief in God is a virtue, and superstition is a sin.

The red thread is tied on Borisov's arm by the doctor Shcherona Vaklusheva. "I put the red thread on Borisov's hand."

Grandmother Mita from the village of. Prilep from Dobrich threw beans to Borisov when he was Secretary General. And she told him everything - that she was going to make a party, she was going to become prime minister... And he gave her BGN 10 (then he still gave his own, so only 10!)

Christianity has nothing to do with fortune tellers, diviners, astrologers, healers, correctors of fate. Many Bulgarians are not aware of this. Borisov admits without embarrassment that he is as superstitious as a grandmother. When a black cat crossed his path, he turned around three times before moving on, and if he was with the motorcade, he made the guards turn back and go down another street. He always got up with his right foot forward, he didn't shave on Mondays, he didn't cut his nails, and he didn't borrow money...

My grandmother, a really pious grandmother, when she would go on a journey, she would just cross herself and say, "God speed!" And neither black cats nor bad eyes of the people brought her back...

An enlightened person cannot be so superstitious! Such superstition is inherent in the rustic spirituality of previous centuries. Although, on the other hand, the hieromonks Vissarion and John say in "Superstitions among Christians Today" that "superstition depends neither on intellect nor on education. Often great scholars appear to be superstitious men." Well, in this case it is not a question of great scholars, de...

Just in passing, I will note that there are also individual clairvoyants.Once on "Horizon" I came across the psychic Nikoleta Yordanova. She said about the MPs. An assessment that would do honour to many political scientists, wouldn't it?

And the astrologers believe Borisov. First he believed a lot in Leszczanski. But then Alena wrote that in his previous life Borisov was a general in England in the XVII century. And probably he started trusting her from then on. And for one birthday he wrote to her, "I will not conceal that I take your advice and thank you for your accurate guidance."

And it was right to hide, because it appears that the state is guided by astrologers.

And this same superstitious person, who has no clue of the Christian catechism, is dying to pretend to be pious! And the popes bind him, Zer is in power and donates generously from the people's steam. He goes around the churches, gets baptized, kisses the icons and the hands of the popes, gives icons and they give him gifts... Zealous as any proselyte. From his confessions we learnt that he was pious from a short time ago, he became pious by the king. Before that he was a communist, a member of the Communist Party who refused to depoliticize. And the Communists, as you know, confessed Christ shortly after November 10. Like that citizen of Ilf and Petrov, who recognized the Soviet power a little later than England and a little earlier than Greece...

But to such a clergy, such pasoms... My friend wrote on Facebook about the bishop of Lovchan: "It and Tsvetan Dinev, with the thug alias Gavriel, is the same spoiled goods as Borisov." Zachary Stoyanov wrote: "Once the robbers hung on the cross, now the cross hangs on the robbers."

With us it is always the same time... And the party of the Pharisees always wins - both in the church and outside it.

If my voice could reach the people of those villages and hamlets where the prime minister goes around like a "gloa bitch", as the intellectuals of Pazardzhik put it, I would ask them: how come, people, how come you are not tired of living in this hypocrisy for ten years?! A superstitious person preaching Christianity to you, a former communist teaching you anti-communism, a thief teaching you morality, a pathological liar teaching you honesty, a corrupt thug teaching you patriotism, a vain to the point of pathology person teaching you modesty?!!  How can you not be tired of a billionaire, who only in his locker pockets a ten-year average pension, to throw you 50 leva alms?!

And maybe you're not bored for a reason? Maybe Chekhov is right. "The mass, always prone to anthropomorphism in religion and morality, worships just those idols that have its weaknesses." Who knows...

If we want to be honest in advance, we have to admit that hypocrisy will not go away with Borissov. The person, the emblem of corruption in GERB Cicero made a party and is preparing for elections. The friend of the thugs Slavi Trifonov is also preparing. You remember how he roared on TV when Georgi Iliev was shot. You remember the Grenzis... If you remembered, they would hardly dare to make parties. But both Slavi and Tsvetanov know and remember that you don't remember...

Especially for the intellectuals who ask what will come when we overthrow Borisov, I will say. Now the task is to overthrow the thug. And then, if we are not tired of it, we can think and remember that our enemy is not this or that cabinet, but the status quo itself. It is a llama with three heads and five asses, as a grandfather used to say. In place of every severed head grows a new head and two new asses. We cannot smell it. We need a bomb. The status quo is crime, the status quo is corruption, the status quo is poverty and misery, screwed up education and sick healthcare, the self-serving political class and the venal intelligentsia... They are the status quo and we are the status quo. We are in it and it is in us...

And I will tell you a little "secret". So far, in the fight against the status quo, we have always come second, because we always let someone else lead this fight for us. And for that someone else, the struggle to change the status quo ends with the change of status.

I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be now too, dammit (no excuse)!

But that doesn't mean we should give up. Remember... Excuse me...

I wanted to quote a short dialogue from Kestner's "Fabian" that I've probably mentioned to you before:

- 'The sensible will not come to power,' said Fabian, 'still less the just.

- So!"Laboude stepped very close to his friend and grabbed the collar of his coat with both hands. - But shouldn't they still dare?

So they do!
